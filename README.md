# To Contribute

- We do not commit to `master` branch directly. We open pull requests and merge them in master after review.
- Create the issue as necessary.
- If you lack the technical knowhow, feel free ask in the slack workspace.
- Create a Branch and Commit your changes.
  - Name the branch carefully. For example `feature-card-component`, `bugfix-overlay`. Do not use generic names such as `develop`, `work`, your username etc.
  - Name the commits meaningfully. For help read [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Check if the solution works by testing it locally.
- Submit a PR with an appropriate name including the term `Fixes #{issue number}` if it fixes that particular issue.
- Be attentive and respond to comments and suggestions in the opened PR.
- We will merge your PR after reviewing and testing it.

# While contributing

- Use **prettier** extension for code linting

## Deployment

Note that the `master` branch is deployed to server through [Midgard](https://midgard.iit-techambit.in). Any commits pushed to `master` will be deployed to server instantly

A manual deployment can be triggered by going to the midgard dashboard.
